1
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,197
God damn it!

2
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,158
I closed the gate.

3
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,077
I can break through.

4
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,037
What are you doing?

5
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,539
I need food for my battery.

6
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,709
You had a fully charged battery.
You didn't make a dent.

7
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,212
No. We're not getting through that thing,
whatever it is, not this way at least.

8
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,130
We have to.

9
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,882
We don't even know
if Holly's on the other side.

10
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,303
The trail could've gone cold
for a million reasons.

11
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,765
Battery.

12
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,776
Anything else?

13
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,112
Hey! I... No, I don't have anything else.

14
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,033
I was packing for a party of one,
a party of me.

15
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,746
{\an8}You're lucky I'm sharing with you.

16
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,252
Try it.

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
You might like it.

18
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,343
Hmm?

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,022
We gotta go.

20
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,326
El?

21
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,703
You okay?

22
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,454
What's wrong? You all right?

23
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,341
Will, Robin, I need you to answer me.

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,970
I'm not mad.
I just need to know you're safe.

25
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,518
Shit.

26
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,311
- Is that, uh...
- Yeah.

27
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,772
You think she saw us?

28
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,108
Yeah.

29
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,868
Get in.

30
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,206
I told you, I explicitly told you,

31
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,209
I didn't want him going anywhere
that's not safe.

32
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,088
And not only did you take him,
you cut off all communication.

33
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,466
Yes, I mean, in retrospect,
that was a bit inconsiderate.

34
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,592
Inconsiderate?

35
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,177
We really should've left a note.

36
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,596
Is this funny to you?

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,014
Oh. Sorry. It must be my tone.

38
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,100
My mother says
I sound perpetually insincere.

39
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,146
Okay, this is my son's life
you're playing with.

40
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,564
My son.

41
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,442
So next time I say
I do not want him leaving my side,

42
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,071
that means I don't want him
leaving my goddamn side.

43
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,448
I'm right here, Mom.

44
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,367
You know, you can talk to me, right?

45
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,994
And I'm not a kid anymore.

46
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,121
Will, I am still your mother.

47
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,331
- Doesn't mean you know what you're doing.
- What?

48
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,458
Your plan? It... It sucked.

49
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,710
I'm sorry, but it did.

50
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,628
You only liked it because it was safe,

51
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,797
but we don't have time for safe, not anymore.

52
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,884
We have to act, and we have to take risks,
and thank God we did.

53
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,136
Because my plan, it... it actually worked.

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,722
I spied on Vecna
and tapped back into the hive mind,

55
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,141
and we found out
that Holly was just the beginning.

56
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,767
Vecna is gonna take more kids.

57
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,811
I don't know why
or what he wants to do with them,

58
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,274
but now we know something
we can use against him, his next target.

59
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,194
So next time you order me to stay
by your side, I wouldn't count on it.

60
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,992
But, as I said, in the future,
we will try to leave a note.

61
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,205
We should go. We have to stop Vecna.
We don't have much time.

62
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,936
- Ready for the biosphere?
- Yes, I am.

63
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,648
Okay. Think about the difference
between land and water.

64
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,442
Okay, got it. Thank you!

65
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,694
Hey!

66
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,297
You still thinking about your parents?

67
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,716
Yeah.

68
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,470
They are in the very best possible hands,
Holly, I assure you.

69
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,182
And I'm told that they are improving
with each hour that passes.

70
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,101
As soon as they're healed,
they'll join us here.

71
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,811
I... I know.

72
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,564
- It's just--
- You wish to be with them.

73
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,524
I understand.

74
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,902
But you cannot offer them comfort
in Hawkins, Holly.

75
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,156
The only comfort they have
is knowing you are here, safe.

76
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,991
With me.

77
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,909
Safe from the monsters.

78
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,082
I thought blackberries
might cheer you up a little.

79
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,293
They're your favorite, aren't they?

80
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
How did you know?

81
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,046
That they're my favorite?

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,672
Oh, it's, uh...

83
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,716
It's just a hunch.

84
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,634
I'm good with hunches.

85
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,638
Perhaps tomorrow
I'll make chocolate chip pancakes.

86
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,391
- He loves those.
- Who does?

87
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,850
Your classmate, Derek.

88
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,685
Derek is coming here?

89
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,647
You don't like Derek very much, do you?

90
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,569
Should I just let the monsters eat him?

91
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,574
No. No, you can't... you can't do that.

92
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,077
Well, how about this?

93
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,453
I will tell Derek

94
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,165
that if he misbehaves,
or if he hurts you in any way,

95
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,378
I will send him right back,
and he can face those monsters on his own.

96
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,379
How does that sound?

97
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,638
I expect to be gone most of the day.

98
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,808
While I'm out, you'll have
the whole house all to yourself.

99
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,226
The whole house?

100
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,312
Everything which is mine is yours.

101
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,982
But in return,
I need you to promise me one thing.

102
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,277
Something very important.
Do you think you can do that?

103
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,362
Yeah.

104
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:55,701
You must never, under any circumstance,
go out into the woods. Do you understand?

105
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,830
Is that where the monsters live?

106
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,917
But they won't find you.
That is, as long as you don't--

107
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,086
Don't try to find them.

108
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,881
You know, I'm very glad I saved you first.

109
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,884
You're the brightest of them all.

110
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,807
Oh, and if you don't mind,
bring my mail in, won't you?

111
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,444
How did you know?

112
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,154
A hunch.

113
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,459
Base, Alpha one checking in.

114
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,045
We're arrived at checkpoint H,
H for Hercules.

115
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,421
No sign of freak.

116
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,841
We'll recon this area,
then proceed to next checkpoint. Over.

117
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,387
<i>Alpha 1, Base. Acknowledge
your location at Hercules. Over.</i>

118
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,639
Alpha 1, out.

119
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,474
Recon?

120
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,851
Meaning, I take a leak,

121
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,062
and you guys take five.

122
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,399
You heard the man.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

123
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,910
Some jackass messing with the wall,
Lieutenant?

124
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,037
Some jackass, yeah.

125
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,374
But not one of ours.

126
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
Come on.

127
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,507
Get on the hedgehog.

128
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,592
Yes, sir.

129
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,931
- Oh!
- Hey!

130
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,854
Come up! Come up!

131
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,899
Base, Alpha 1, we're taking enemy fire.
Need backup and air cover now.

132
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,651
Move!

133
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,098
Okay.

134
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,063
Who's there?

135
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,162
It looks like
Robin sent up the Bat-Signal.

136
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,472
Hey. I'm so sorry.

137
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,306
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

138
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,266
Here.

139
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,853
Holy shit.

140
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,979
Yep.

141
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,857
Bike crash.
Flew headfirst into a light post.

142
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,777
Look, I'm sorry about missing the crawl,
about everything.

143
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,988
It's not your fault.
Don't beat yourself up.

144
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,781
Yeah, looks like he already did.

145
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,241
- Is that broken?
- I dunno.

146
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,659
- Let me...
- Don't touch it. Why--

147
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,703
- I wasn't... I wanted to...
- You were going to.

148
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,706
Hey, this isn't a social call, kiddos.
Let's go.

149
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,254
<i>Derek?</i>

150
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,380
<i>Derek Turnbow?</i>

151
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,050
As in the Turnbow family?
Like Turnbow Realty?

152
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,552
The one and only.

153
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,554
Whole family's a menace.

154
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,014
How can you be sure?

155
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,224
Sure that Derek's the next target?

156
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,394
Because I saw.

157
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,022
<i>I've learned that
when I'm close enough to the hive mind,</i>

158
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,399
I can tap into it, into Vecna's mind.

159
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,443
<i>I can see who he's targeting.</i>

160
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,030
<i>The first time it happened,
I saw through Holly's eyes</i>

161
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,865
<i>the same day she was taken.</i>

162
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,661
<i>And this morning, it happened again.</i>

163
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,332
<i>Only this time, I wasn't Holly.</i>

164
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,000
- What the hell?
<i>- I was someone else.</i>

165
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,336
- Watch where you're going, dipshit.
- Suck a fat one!

166
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,880
I was Derek Turnbow. I'm positive.

167
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,006
Hold on. I'm a little lost.

168
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,215
Shocking.

169
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,011
Were you seeing through the eyes
of... of Vecna or of Derek?

170
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,262
Both.

171
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,972
I... I was Vecna,

172
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,558
but inside Derek's mind.

173
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,936
Vecna's like a psychic serial killer.

174
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,314
He stalks his victims,
but he does it by invading their minds.

175
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,650
That's what he did with Chrissy and Max.

176
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,361
Yeah, but the way
he's doing it this time is different.

177
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,406
We did some digging at the hospital.
It turns out that before he took Holly,

178
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,574
Vecna stalked her.

179
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,454
But... he didn't appear as Vecna.
He appeared as Henry.

180
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,039
As a friend.

181
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,123
We think he was trying to earn her trust.

182
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,250
Now, why he went to all that trouble,
we don't know.

183
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,878
But I highly doubt
his long-term goal is friendship.

184
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,548
Whatever it is, whatever he's planning,

185
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,467
we have to stop him.

186
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,719
And we have to save Derek.

187
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,096
The Turnbows live here.

188
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,806
We wait in a van across the street.

189
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,642
As soon as they're asleep,
we move in, we grab Derek,

190
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,269
and we take him to here,

191
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,439
the McCorkle farm.
It's completely isolated. It's abandoned.

192
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:51,361
The only thing is, we need to make sure
he doesn't see us or know where he is.

193
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,737
So we'll need to blindfold him.

194
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,489
Wait. Hold on. What?

195
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,949
So that Vecna can't find him.

196
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,744
Yeah. What, and Mom,
you're okay with just kidnapping a child?

197
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,664
No, we're saving a child via kidnapping.

198
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,249
And yeah, it's fine,

199
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,167
I think.

200
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,336
Yes. Now's not the time
to play it safe, Jonathan.

201
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,171
If I may,

202
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,550
though I'm not morally opposed
to any of this, there are a few holes.

203
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,679
Yeah. Like what if Derek falls asleep
before the Demogorgon attacks him?

204
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,680
That's one.

205
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,934
Or what if Derek wakes up
before we grab him, alerts his family?

206
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,020
- We'll go to jail.
- There's another.

207
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,981
But the third and most gaping hole is

208
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,651
even if by some miracle this plan even works,

209
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,277
Holly's still missing.

210
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,946
Hop and El, still MIA.

211
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,198
This doesn't bring us any closer
to finding Vecna.

212
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,826
This plan just buys us and Derek some time.

213
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,786
That's it.

214
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,328
Not necessarily.

215
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,622
There might be a way.

216
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,668
A way to save Derek and find Holly.

217
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,548
This is Derek.

218
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,885
And this is the rest of the Turnbow family.

219
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,680
We're gonna need to recruit someone
that the family trusts,

220
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,558
someone that can gain access to the house.

221
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,894
This person will knock the family out.

222
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,520
Then we'll extract the family.

223
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,605
Knock them out?

224
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,441
Well, safely.
With sleeping pills or something.

225
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,443
I might know where we could get some benzos.

226
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,737
Those things could knock an elephant
on its ass.

227
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,489
Perfect. That way if Vecna spies,

228
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,783
he'll just assume
Derek is fast asleep in bed.

229
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,493
He'll send his Demos to grab him.

230
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,997
Only he won't find Derek. He'll find us.

231
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,539
And we'll be ready.

232
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,334
We'll get Murray to supply us with the traps.

233
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,212
We'll burn the sucker.
Send him scampering home to its master,

234
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,506
but not before we stick him
with one of these.

235
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,426
We'll track the Demo across the Upside Down

236
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,845
in the Squawk van
just like we did with Hopper.

237
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,307
And if we're lucky,
the Demo will lead us back to its lair,

238
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,392
to Vecna,

239
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,186
to Holly.

240
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,605
Holes?

241
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,073
<i>Children behave</i>

242
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,244
<i>That's what they say
When we're together</i>

243
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,331
<i>Cause what would they say</i>

244
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,250
<i>If they ever knew and so we're</i>

245
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,004
<i>Running just as fast as we can</i>

246
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,925
<i>Holdin' onto one another's hand</i>

247
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,427
<i>Tryin' to get away into the night</i>

248
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,721
<i>And then you put your arms around me</i>

249
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,683
<i>And we tumble to the ground
And then you say</i>

250
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,602
<i>- I think we're alone now
- Alone now</i>

251
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,523
<i>There doesn't seem to be anyone around</i>

252
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,818
<i>- I think we're alone now
- Alone now</i>

253
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,989
<i>The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound</i>

254
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,701
<i>- I think we're alone now
- Alone now</i>

255
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,749
<i>- I think we're alone now
- Alone now</i>

256
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,003
<i>The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound</i>

257
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,090
<i>- I think we're alone now
- Alone now</i>

258
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,177
<i>There doesn't seem to be anyone around</i>

259
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,556
<i>- I think we're alone now
- Alone now</i>

260
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,657
Henry?

261
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,413
Derek, if this is you,
it's not funny, you barf bag!

262
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,577
"I need your help."

263
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,330
"Meet me at the X."

264
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,290
"Henry."

265
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,718
East.

266
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,073
Move aside.
Coming through! Make way, please!

267
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,201
You're gonna be okay, man.
Just hang in there.

268
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,289
Sir!

269
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,375
Orders?

270
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,212
Find who did this.

271
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,130
Bring them to me.

272
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,466
And I will disembowel the son of a bitch!

273
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,676
Sir!

274
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,303
Let's go! Move out!

275
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,231
Got that Humvee hid pretty good.

276
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,192
If they don't know it's missing yet,
they will soon.

277
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,444
Got more birds.

278
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,863
They all got those speakers,
whatever they are.

279
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,577
I don't know how, but...

280
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,415
Seems like our military friends
found your kryptonite.

281
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,252
Hey.

282
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,754
Any movement from our guest?

283
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,884
Better not be brain-dead.

284
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,808
He peed on it.

285
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,603
What?

286
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,565
That soldier.

287
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,816
You said he peed on the big wall.

288
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,485
Yeah, no, I heard <i>what</i> you said.

289
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,737
I just don't know
why you're talking about it.

290
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,115
Maybe he knows what it is...

291
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,367
Or how to get through it.

292
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,703
That's highly doubtful.

293
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,830
What he will know, though,

294
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,707
is the schedule for the next supply convoy,

295
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,419
which is our way out of this hellhole.

296
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,338
What happens then?

297
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,261
We go back,
we tell everybody what we saw, and we... we...

298
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,346
Make a new plan.

299
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:38,143
The others? You think
they'll know how to get through the wall?

300
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,646
I don't know. Maybe, yeah.

301
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,814
They won't.

302
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,941
We'll be back to the first square.

303
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,818
- Square one.
- He peed on it.

304
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,861
Even if he knows something,

305
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,281
he's been trained to resist interrogation.

306
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,158
The Russians took two weeks
trying to break me,

307
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,785
and they still couldn't.

308
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,538
We don't have two weeks.
We don't have two hours.

309
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,083
Convoy information,
I might be able to get out of him.

310
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,378
Classified information?
That's not gonna happen.

311
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,255
With my help, it will.

312
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,339
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

313
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,467
I forgot about your extensive training
in interrogation tactics.

314
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,844
My battery's charged.

315
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,512
I don't see how that helps us.

316
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,055
- I can break him.
- El...

317
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,182
Twenty minutes.

318
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,268
You get to ask him about the convoy.

319
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,853
You get what you want,

320
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,772
then I get what I want.

321
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,485
Compromise. "C-O-M-promise." Remember?

322
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,736
Halfway happy.

323
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,240
Hey, what is this?

324
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,617
Get me outta here!
Get me the hell outta here!

325
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,787
You're a stubborn punk-ass.
You know that, right?

326
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,791
{\an8}Einstein-Rosen bridges,

327
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,169
{\an8}more commonly known as wormholes,

328
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,963
are often depicted
in an hourglass-like shape,

329
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,048
such as this.

330
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,010
While the existence of wormholes
is entirely theoretical,

331
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,636
they have captured the fascination

332
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,015
of scientists
and science fiction writers alike.

333
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,976
Can anyone tell me why that is?

334
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,772
Come on. This is easy. Just...

335
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,692
What's neat about wormholes?

336
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,071
Okay. Erica.

337
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,739
Wormholes are neat

338
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,493
because they allow matter to travel
between galaxies or dimensions

339
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,369
without crossing the space between.

340
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,372
Yes. Exactly right.

341
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,040
Again.

342
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:28,878
And, uh, just think of all the places
mankind could go.

343
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,630
Another galaxy.

344
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,423
Another time, even.

345
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,675
So why aren't we doing it now?

346
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,555
If wormholes did exist,
they would be extraordinarily unstable.

347
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,267
Their enormous gravitational force
would rip them apart

348
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,313
at the very moment they formed. Now...

349
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:55,404
You have 60 seconds to explain
why you interrupted my favorite class.

350
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,907
Erica, this is really serious.

351
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,992
57, 56...

352
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,453
It's hard
to explain everything in 56 seconds.

353
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,957
But basically, everything went bad
at the crawl last night.

354
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,500
Wouldn't know. I wasn't invited.

355
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,461
That's why I'm ex--

356
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,004
That's why I'm explaining.

357
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,132
Things went bad at the crawl,
and a lot of stuff happened,

358
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,718
and now we think
Tina's little brother's in trouble.

359
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,428
That literally makes no sense.

360
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,932
And even if it did, why would I care
that Dipshit Derek is in trouble?

361
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,059
You're just gonna have to trust us, okay?

362
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,854
And to help Derek, we're gonna need you
to get us into the Turnbow house.

363
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,106
- Tonight.
- Not possible.

364
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,191
Of course it is.
Make plans to hang out with Tina.

365
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,194
- Tina and I don't hang.
- You hang nonstop. She's your best friend.

366
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,195
- Was.
- Was?

367
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,530
- We are now enemies.
- Enemies?

368
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,823
- Arch.
- Since when?

369
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,616
Since PE class 12 days ago.

370
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,035
Then apologize for what happened
in PE class 12 days ago.

371
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,037
- No can do.
- Yes, can do.

372
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:49,458
All you have to do is use your mouth
to form a word that rhymes with "starry."

373
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,587
I'd rather learn about wormholes
than apologize to Tina

374
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,006
and help you all save Dipshit Derek.

375
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,050
Sorry.

376
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,302
Time's up.

377
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,890
This isn't about saving Derek.
It's about saving Holly.

378
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,393
Vecna took her.

379
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,730
And yeah, now he's after Dipshit Derek.
But we have a plan.

380
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,983
A plan to both save Dipshit Derek
and find Holly.

381
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,693
But the plan is...

382
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,278
It's a bit insane.

383
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,571
But after it's over,

384
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,950
I don't think
Tina's gonna wanna talk to you ever again.

385
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,245
Well, why the hell
didn't you just start with that?

386
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,213
Hi, Doris.

387
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,633
Oh! You here to see Mrs. Massey?

388
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,886
- You are just psychic, I'm telling you.
- I am. Thank you, baby.

389
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
- Thank you.
- Y'all go on back there.

390
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,891
Mm!

391
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,100
Who's Mrs. Massey?

392
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,311
My sweet granny
who fell down a flight of stairs

393
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,521
and broke nearly every bone
in her frail old body.

394
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,106
Oh God. I'm sorry.

395
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,233
Don't be too sorry.
She's not my real granny.

396
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,027
I use her name so I can visit Vickie.

397
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,655
I know it sounds unethical,
but I always bring her cookies,

398
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,616
and I think Mrs. Massey loves me
more than her own family at this point.

399
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,161
More importantly, she has got, like,
a mondo stash of benzos,

400
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,872
and her nurse is a slacker
who never locks the medicine cabinet.

401
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,207
...This story I heard.

402
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,459
- Shit.
- Oh!

403
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,294
- What... What are we doing?
- Hiding.

404
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,380
- Hiding? Right. Why?
- Down.

405
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,887
Jesus, she talks so much.

406
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,472
- I know. I'm a hypocrite.
- I...

407
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,640
We have to go!

408
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:36,148
I promised Vickie
that I would take her to Enzo's tonight,

409
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,150
and now I can't, obviously,

410
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,777
meaning I have to ditch her again

411
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,738
for reasons that she just can't understand.

412
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,200
A massive fight will ensue, and we'll
never make it to my fake granny's room.

413
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,285
I can't be the reason
Wheeler's plan fails.

414
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,538
- Okay?
- Okay.

415
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,375
Shoot. Stay low.

416
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,805
You know,
you could always just kiss her again.

417
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,598
I knew that was your goddamn bowl cut.

418
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,311
Yeah, I mean,
they're not that popular anymore.

419
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,439
Did I look like
I knew what I was doing at least?

420
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,400
I mean, yeah. To me.

421
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,153
I guess that's something.

422
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,323
So, how did you know
that, with Vickie, right?

423
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,908
How did you know that Vickie wanted to...

424
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,160
- Make out?
- ...To date?

425
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,872
Oh. Well, we volunteered together.
You know, there were, like, signals.

426
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,123
Signals?

427
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:38,044
Yeah, you know, like a brush of the knee,
a bump of the elbow, a shared look.

428
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,173
It all just kind of accrued,
like a snowball rolling down a hill,

429
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,299
until it was obvious.

430
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,426
How obvious?

431
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,473
Let's say the, uh, snowball
became an avalanche.

432
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,735
Oh God, that looks awful.

433
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,736
Sure does.

434
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,364
And he's in the same wing as my fake granny.

435
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,867
- Meaning?
- Same slacker nurse.

436
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,787
Jackpot.

437
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,623
Jesus, we could knock out half of Hawkins
with this shit.

438
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,876
- Okay, load me up.
- Okay.

439
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,178
<i>Okay, so, I couldn't get any ethanol,</i>

440
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:33,557
but I was able to scrounge up
a gallon of acetone.

441
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,475
Be very careful.

442
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,021
You smoke a Virginia Slim too close
to this stuff, it'll catch fire, okay?

443
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,482
Snare wire, various gauges.

444
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,486
A creepy, child-sized CPR dummy.

445
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,572
Its purpose a mystery to me.

446
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,577
Shotgun shells,
per our lovely lady's request.

447
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,248
{\an8}Three 20-packs of water balloons.
Purpose also a mystery.

448
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,459
{\an8}But I did take the liberty
of selecting the grenade style

449
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,087
{\an8}as it felt thematically appropriate.

450
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,299
Do keep those far away from...

451
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,594
These 3,000 feet of barbed wire.

452
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,764
Oh, I almost forgot.

453
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,517
Some sparkling new spark plugs
for Bilbo Baggins.

454
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,521
Spark plugs, that's it?

455
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,314
I'm also giving out free hugs.

456
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,108
- You didn't get the turbocharger?
- No.

457
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,526
- The suspension kit?
- No.

458
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,111
- The aerodynamic spoiler?
- No.

459
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,280
It wasn't a goddamn Christmas list,
Murray.

460
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,574
That's exactly what it was.

461
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:35,119
And the fact that Santa Murray scrounged
all this up in a single afternoon

462
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:39,081
and smuggled it into what is likely
the most heavily secured location

463
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,251
outside of the White House,
Fort Knox, and Area 51

464
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,461
is a goddamn Christmas miracle.

465
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,839
So, count your blessings,

466
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,091
hang some mistletoe, pucker up,

467
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,844
and kiss my jolly ass!

468
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,599
Thank you for the spark plugs.

469
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,528
- What are you doing?
- You gonna help or just stand there?

470
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,906
I'd rather not herniate a disc
over a lost cause.

471
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,824
Yeah, that's the attitude.

472
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,327
This van once stalled out
chugging up Pickett Road

473
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,120
like it was the Little Engine That Couldn't.

474
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,707
It's not fast enough to keep up
with a Demo without serious modifications.

475
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,252
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
Modifying.

476
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,255
A lighter van is a faster van.

477
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,716
If we're just tracking,
we don't need half of the crap in here.

478
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,469
Speaking of, can you go
empty the window washer fluid?

479
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,430
The window washer fluid.
That'll do it. Good job, Steven.

480
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,641
We should go back
to the agreement from yesterday.

481
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,227
- What agreement?
- The no-talking agreement.

482
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,488
<i>Oh yeah</i>

483
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,116
What are you doing?
Henderson, I'm using that.

484
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,952
Hey. You little shit!

485
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,703
I said I'm using that, man.

486
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,789
What are you-- Yo, hey!

487
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,333
Get off the Beamer, man. Get off!

488
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,168
You were right. For once.

489
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,629
We don't need half the crap in there
for our mission.

490
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,675
In fact, the only thing
we really need is a telemetry tracker,

491
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,386
which I can affix to any vehicle.

492
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,345
Henderson...

493
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,972
Don't you touch her.

494
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,723
Henderson!

495
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,559
Henderson, I'm dead serious.

496
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,937
- No talking.
- Wait, wait, wait!

497
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,522
Hey, hey! What are you...

498
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,399
No! What the...

499
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,445
- Okay, transmitter?
- Yeah.

500
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,948
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Children. Children.

501
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,451
- What are we doing?
- What does it look like?

502
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:45,624
Well, it looks like you're loading
my telemetry tracker into a shotgun shell

503
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,584
in what I presume are the hopes

504
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,504
of firing it into an interdimensional being.

505
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,589
You told me that these transmitters

506
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:56,176
were designed specifically
to withstand harsh conditions.

507
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,681
Blasting it out of a shotgun
into some beast isn't a harsh condition.

508
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,641
It's deadly.

509
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:05,352
If the heat from the exploding gunpowder
doesn't destroy the transmitter,

510
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,062
the force from the recoil will.

511
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,648
And is that a fact

512
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,609
or... a theory?

513
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,279
A theory.

514
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,948
Oh. Okay.

515
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,784
Let's test it then.

516
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,246
What's her deal today, huh?

517
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,581
Her deal?

518
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,666
Yeah.

519
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,961
Her sister is missing.
Her parents almost died.

520
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,006
- Sure, sure. But what about, you know?
- No, I don't.

521
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,591
Coltrane, <i>Love Supreme.</i>

522
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,676
- Did you give it a whirl?
- Yeah.

523
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,636
- And?
- It was very nice.

524
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,764
- And?
- What? Thank you?

525
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,975
Christ, man!
You haven't done it yet, have you?

526
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,478
I thought you were desperate,
that things were stagnating,

527
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,354
that your mating competition
was making moves.

528
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,439
- Whoa!
- Hey!

529
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,026
Whatever you two are conspiring about
back there, please do it later.

530
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,652
Our apologies, milady.

531
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,655
And hurry up. We don't have all day.

532
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,949
Why the delay?

533
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,076
Have you forgotten the fact

534
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,995
that her sister is missing
and her parents are in the hospital?

535
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,039
Could one ask for better conditions?

536
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,542
The death of a loved one
is the painful but necessary reminder

537
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,378
that life is delicate, precious,

538
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,131
that one must not take those around us
for granted,

539
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,925
that one must strengthen bonds.

540
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,093
I mean, hell, man,

541
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,763
the two of you were brought together
by shared trauma in the first place.

542
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,057
This is the stuff of fate, of destiny.

543
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,267
So, if not for your sake, then for mine.

544
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,978
Grow some balls and get it over with already.

545
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,773
Hey! If you don't shut up right now, Santa,

546
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,444
I swear to God I will shoot this tracker
into your potato sacks.

547
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,863
I'm a good enough shot to hit any mark,

548
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,656
no matter how small.

549
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,865
Jesus.

550
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,367
Now set up my target.

551
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,994
Okay.

552
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,965
Quite large, actually.

553
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,052
My... potato sacks.

554
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,765
Hmm.

555
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,944
Well, would you look at that, Santa?
Another miracle.

556
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,113
At the very least,

557
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,282
couldn't hurt her mood.

558
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,973
Hey!

559
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,641
How's the head?

560
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,060
You'll get nothing out of me.

561
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,854
So if you're gonna kill me, get to it.

562
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,231
It's tempting.

563
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,149
But no.

564
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,403
Just need a little information, okay?

565
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,157
I need to know about that fleshy wall.

566
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,161
Don't know a thing about it.
I'm just a grunt.

567
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,580
A grunt?

568
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,291
Is that funny to you?

569
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,168
Let me get this straight.
You're telling me you just,

570
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,922
like all the other boots on the ground,
came to Hawkins to direct traffic

571
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,590
and save kitty cats out of trees.

572
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,635
- You're just a red, white, and blue grunt.
- That's what I said.

573
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,263
I used to be a grunt.

574
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,558
So I know the difference.

575
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,645
You're something else.

576
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,773
Some kind of special forces puke.

577
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,485
I used to have to put up
with guys like you in Nam.

578
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,154
Guys who cut the ears off enemy corpses,

579
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,906
make a necklace out of them.

580
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,200
Pretty sick, you ask me.

581
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:53,080
Grunt, my ass.
You're one of Sullivan's attack dogs.

582
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,208
You're the psychos he lets slip off the leash

583
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,877
when he wants to,
I don't know, go into the desert

584
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:03,340
and massacre a group of unarmed scientists
all in the pursuit of one little girl.

585
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,675
Little... Little girl?

586
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,510
She's a freak!

587
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,138
She took down a helicopter
just by looking at it.

588
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,556
I had friends in that Huey, man.

589
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,059
Oh my God! My heart is breaking for you.

590
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,645
You, whoever you are,
you just took out more of my guys,

591
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,105
so go to hell.

592
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,190
I'm already there. Look around you.

593
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,776
I gotta tell you something
about this old ex-grunt.

594
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,030
Those guys I killed,
I'd kill them a hundred times over.

595
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,074
I'd kill a thousand guys like you

596
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,910
to protect the one person that I love.

597
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,207
All right.

598
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,460
So you don't know about the wall, huh?

599
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,504
Who does?

600
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,381
Dr. Kay?

601
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,051
- Who?
- Kay.

602
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,553
The one that even Sullivan takes orders from.

603
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,723
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- Really?

604
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,850
Then why'd you tell us her name?

605
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:55,892
What?

606
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,521
Her name. You told us her name.

607
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,523
Us?

608
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,525
That little girl you're looking for?

609
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,070
<i>She's rooting around
in that tiny brain of yours as we speak.</i>

610
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,239
<i>She can see everything.</i>

611
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,784
Everything you've ever thought,
everything you've ever seen.

612
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,745
So you might as well start talking.

613
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,456
'Cause if you don't give me answers,
she'll find them.

614
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,667
So why don't we save some time?

615
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,127
Where do I find Dr. Kay?

616
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,838
I... I don't know where she is.

617
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,299
You can lie to me all you want.
You can't lie to her.

618
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,593
- I'm not lying to you.
- Yes, you are.

619
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,931
You know this Dr. Kay. Where is Dr. Kay?

620
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,183
I don't know--

621
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,443
Is it really necessary to take
these lashings from Kay in person?

622
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,821
Just shut up and drive, Akers.

623
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,168
There's a base in the Upside Down.

624
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,044
<i>Gable Ridge Road.</i>

625
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:08,715
- Gable Ridge Road Base.
- What the hell is she doing to me?

626
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,760
I don't exactly know how it works,
but I know it's probably not a good idea

627
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,970
to have her rooting around there
for too long.

628
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,640
What was this meeting about
with you and the good doctor?

629
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,936
The freak. She wants the freak.
That's her mission. That's all I know.

630
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,732
You have one more month,
Lieutenant Colonel.

631
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,235
Then I find someone else
to lead this operation.

632
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,738
Thank you, ma'am.

633
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,115
Akers, let's go.

634
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,519
<i>There's a door at the end.</i>

635
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,396
Big, metal,

636
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,398
like a vault.

637
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:11,278
There's a door, a big door, secure door,
down a corridor, down a hallway.

638
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,988
- What's behind that door?
- I don't know.

639
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,865
What's behind that door?

640
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,743
I told you I don't know. God!

641
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,085
There's something back there.
He doesn't want me to see.

642
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,380
- My head! My head!
- Hey, I can make it stop.

643
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,674
What's behind the door?

644
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,511
Secret shit. I don't know.
Just get the freak out, man.

645
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,559
I can make it stop,
but you gotta tell me the truth.

646
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,727
What's behind that door?

647
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,479
Does it have something to do with the wall?

648
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,855
I told you I don't know.

649
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,233
Come on! What's behind the door?!

650
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,623
I swear to God, I don't know!

651
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,334
Just get her out of my head!
Get her out of my head!

652
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,132
Hey, hey, hey!

653
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,138
Hey!

654
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,103
Hey! Hey!

655
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,648
What the hell was that? What happened?

656
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,442
El, are you all right? El?

657
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,443
Kryptonite.

658
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,694
What?

659
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,865
I heard it behind the door,
louder than before.

660
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,117
The doctor's keeping someone there,

661
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,453
someone powerful like me.

662
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,955
It has to be.

663
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,790
It has to be what?

664
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,876
The military,

665
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:50,961
they have him.

666
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,423
They have Vecna.

667
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:01,972
It doesn't make sense. Henry said never
to go into the woods. Never, ever.

668
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,685
Why am I talking to you anyways?

669
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,856
You're a pop star.
What do you know about monsters?

670
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,835
What would you do?

671
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,124
Stupid.

672
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,781
It smells like ass in here, dipshit.

673
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,075
Probably from all my farts.

674
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,618
Disgusting.

675
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,119
Mom wants you down for dinner.

676
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,372
Mom can suck a fat one.

677
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,295
Hey!

678
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,090
Tina! Give it back, Tina!

679
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,885
Tina!

680
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,598
Ah, ah, ah. Enough.

681
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:12,436
How many times must I repeat myself?
This home is not a playground.

682
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:18,817
Derek, wash up.
Tina, get the door, and be polite.

683
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,443
Unless it's a Mormon.

684
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,695
Or a Democrat.

685
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,783
Listen, I know
you probably hate me right now,

686
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,369
but I thought
you might want your favorite pie.

687
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,206
And also, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

688
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,835
I'm so sorry, Tina.

689
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:45,928
She's in.

690
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,679
She's in.

691
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:49,681
Hey. What...

692
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,809
Sinclair, come in. Do you copy?

693
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,437
<i>Yep, this is Sinclair. Copy. Go ahead.</i>

694
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:59,065
Sinclair, I'm confused. I thought
your sister said that Tina was mean.

695
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,735
Oh, no, no.
She's not mean. She's a villain.

696
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,945
Kill the puppies
for a fur coat kind of villain.

697
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,197
<i>Trust me.</i>

698
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,116
How long before the drugs kick in?

699
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,827
- Depends how much pie they eat.
- And how fast they eat it.

700
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,289
- What they had for lunch.
- Caffeine intake, alcohol intake.

701
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,540
It's a lot of variables.

702
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,376
Yeah, what could go wrong, right?

703
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,170
Aside from everything.

704
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,634
Aw, you know,
I'm so happy you girls made up.

705
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,678
We've missed you, Erica. Haven't we, dear?

706
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,347
- We missed this pie, that's for sure.
- Hmm.

707
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,017
Now, Erica,
you've done something different this time.

708
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,101
Sorry?

709
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,980
Your pie. It's got
a little... something extra tonight.

710
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,732
A little hint of...

711
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,650
Nutmeg.

712
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,651
Nutmeg! Of course.

713
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:47,197
Brilliant. Brilliant. Brill... Brilliant.

714
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,699
Tina, aren't you gonna try some?

715
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:53,995
Oh, I wish. Looks super good.
Just gotta watch those calories, you know.

716
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,747
Fatty McFatFat.

717
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,874
Derek, remember what we talked about.

718
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,169
If you don't have something nice to say,
don't say it at all.

719
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,839
This is how you alienate your spears, Derek.

720
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,090
My spears?

721
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:10,428
Your spears. Sph... Spheres. Peers.

722
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,680
Holy shit, Dad's wasted again.

723
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,933
Derek. Please, language.

724
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:19,020
{\an8}Well, I used a low-fat creamer,
so you can enjoy guilt-free.

725
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,481
{\an8}Thanks, but I'm just not hungry.

726
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,650
But I made it for you.

727
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,693
I said I'm not hungry.

728
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,028
Just a bite or two.

729
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,322
- Okay, why are you being so weird?
- What?

730
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,616
Why do you care so much
if I eat your stupid pie?

731
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,368
Because it's for you.

732
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,662
Oh my God.
It's because you want me fat, isn't it?

733
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,122
- Girls, please.
- Why would I want you fat?

734
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,166
Because you're still jealous of me and Josh,

735
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,669
and you wanna sabotage our chances
of being together.

736
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,213
I was never jealous of you and Josh.

737
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,591
- Then how do you explain PE?
- It was an accident.

738
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,927
Ken, where are you going?

739
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,345
I'm not feeling good.

740
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,888
It wasn't an accident.

741
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,683
It was dodgeball.
In dodgeball, you throw balls at people.

742
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,311
Not that hard. You gave Joshy
a black eye. Now he won't even look at me.

743
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,730
That's stupid. You didn't throw the ball.

744
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,607
It doesn't matter. He associates us.

745
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,610
He associates us. And you humiliated him.

746
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:11,073
He humiliated himself
by crying like a goddamn pussy.

747
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,119
Ken?

748
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,499
Oh my God.

749
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,042
Mommy!

750
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,126
Mommy!

751
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,170
Mom.

752
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,464
Erica, call 911! Erica!

753
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,633
Mom, wake up.

754
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,093
Erica!

755
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,720
Mommy, wake up. Daddy.

756
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,972
Erica, I told you to call 911.

757
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,310
And I told you to eat your damn pie.

758
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,269
- This is gonna work.
- It better work.

759
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,897
It's not like we're conspicuous or anything.

760
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,237
<i>Hey. Talk to me, guys.
How's it looking out there?</i>

761
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,280
It's boring.

762
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,407
<i>How are the Turnbows holding up?</i>

763
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:45,912
They're still in their "food comas,"
but I swear to God, this Demo better show.

764
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,955
<i>If we took out an entire family for nothing,</i>

765
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,584
<i>my conscience will never recover.</i>

766
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,594
I thought you quit.

767
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,345
Quit what?

768
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,806
Pretty smooth.

769
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,349
Thanks.

770
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,226
Where's your coat?

771
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,602
It's in the barn.

772
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,772
Well, you should get it
if you're gonna be out here.

773
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,400
Mom,

774
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,235
about this morning...

775
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,653
Will, it's fine.

776
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,321
No, no, it's not.

777
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:24,992
I shouldn't have talked to you that way,
and I was a jerk, and I'm sorry.

778
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,162
Honey, I'm sorry too.

779
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,789
I know I can be...

780
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,292
I can be a lot.

781
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,753
That's not true.

782
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,924
It's just,
when I couldn't find you this morning...

783
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,508
I don't know.

784
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,847
I think about that night all the time.

785
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,224
The night it came for you,

786
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,309
the night all this started.

787
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,063
I wasn't even home.

788
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,189
My shift ran late.

789
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,233
When I finally do get home, what do I do?

790
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:04,157
I smoke cigarettes, drink cheap wine,
and watch <i>Cheers</i> reruns until I pass out.

791
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,953
I didn't know you were missing
for eight hours.

792
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,707
Mom, what happened to me,
it's not your fault.

793
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,626
Eight hours.

794
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,131
What kind of mother
doesn't check on their 11-year-old boy?

795
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,510
That is ridiculous!

796
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,097
The jury's still out on your new friend.

797
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,934
She certainly is interesting.

798
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,939
But one thing I know for sure,

799
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,024
she's not your mom.

800
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,319
She hasn't seen what I've seen,

801
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,613
and I am not gonna look away.

802
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:48,743
Not again.
Not until this is over, and you're safe.

803
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:54,708
You don't have to look away, Mom.
I... I just... I need you to trust me.

804
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,543
I do trust you, Will.

805
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,047
But, you know, trust is a two-way street.

806
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:07,595
Even though my plan last night
kind of sucked...

807
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,390
- Kind of?
- Hey!

808
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,685
Let's get your coat on.

809
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,564
It's a lot harder to save the world
if you have the sniffles.

810
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:25,154
So, like, what kind of criminals
does your uncle defend exactly?

811
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,698
You know,
are they, like, white-collar criminals?

812
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,493
Because that does seem like
a Harrington thing to do,

813
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,411
like, defend rich douchebags.

814
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,496
And in this situation,

815
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,541
I think that the rich douchebags
would be coming for us.

816
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:40,754
<i>Steve?</i>

817
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,588
<i>Steve? Are you there?</i>

818
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,340
Yeah, I hear you. Just stop talking.

819
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,842
I think we've got company.

820
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,554
Moving south down Arlington,
T-minus 30 seconds.

821
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,890
South down Arlington, T-minus 30 seconds.

822
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,558
Status check. Taggers?

823
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,811
In position and set. Launcher?

824
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,772
Set. Catcher?

825
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,690
Set. Trackers?

826
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,818
Set. Let's do this thing already.

827
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,292
It's inside.

828
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,501
Minimize chatter.

829
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,545
It's inside. Keep your traps shut.

830
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,401
Catch this!

831
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,312
Get him!

832
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,114
Now!

833
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,079
Nancy!

834
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,082
Nancy! Hurry! Come on!

835
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,297
Get him, Mike! Get him, Mike!
Mike, get him! Get him!

836
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,800
Ah!

837
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,638
It flipped! It flipped!

838
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:41,684
Signal acquired. Headed our way.

839
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,852
How close?

840
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,230
Dustin, how close?

841
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,858
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

842
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,068
Shit.

843
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,612
Jesus Christ!

844
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,363
Where is it?

845
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,032
Hold your horses.

846
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,370
Bearing northwest and fast.

847
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,581
- Oh, come on.
- Demo tagged and released.

848
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,210
Trackers in pursuit.
Repeat, trackers in pursuit. Hit it!

849
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,552
All right, signal holding.
Just keep steady.

850
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,096
Holding. Turn right.

851
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,515
- Right?
- Right! Turn right! Right now!

852
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,816
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

853
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,027
Whoa! You're gonna crash!

854
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,821
- You said right!
- Jesus Christ!

855
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,325
Stop! Stop! Stop right now! Stop here!

856
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,787
God damn it! Henderson, what are we doing?

857
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,997
We lost the signal!

858
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,333
- Come on. Come on!
- Shit, shit, shit.

859
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,626
Shit, shit, shit.

860
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,629
- I got it! It's headed southeast now!
- God damn it.

861
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,464
- Jesus!
- Sorry!

862
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,216
It's okay.

863
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,302
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit!
- Hang on!

864
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,595
Shit, shit, shit!

865
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,347
Jesus Christ.

866
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,515
All right, I've got it.

867
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,517
- You got it?
- Yes, I got it.

868
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,319
Why would they turn around?

869
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,154
Maybe he's trying to shake them?

870
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:20,033
No, that's impossible.
It doesn't know it's being tracked.

871
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,414
Stay away from me! Stay away!

872
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:28,916
No, no, no, no, no.

873
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,043
I'm so, so sorry, okay?

874
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,255
I'll probably explain this at some point,
but for now, don't move.

875
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,465
- I thought he ate, like, two slices.
- He did!

876
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,675
Why is he awake then?

877
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,885
It doesn't matter.

878
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,845
Not anymore.

879
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,441
We're southeast.

880
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,693
That's why it turned around.

881
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,740
Vecna's seen.

882
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,784
He knows where we are.

883
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,238
Hello?

884
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,198
Henry?

885
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,492
Are you there?

886
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,915
Henry?

887
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,724
Hi.

888
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,792
<i>Children behave</i>

889
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:02,379
<i>That's what they say
When we're together</i>

890
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:06,008
<i>And watch how you play</i>

891
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,510
<i>They don't understand and so we're</i>

892
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,722
<i>Running just as fast as we can</i>

893
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,935
<i>Holdin' onto one another's hand</i>

894
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,521
<i>Tryin' to get away into the night</i>

895
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,440
<i>And then you put your arms around me</i>

896
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,859
<i>And we tumble to the ground
And then you say</i>

897
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:27,321
<i>I think we're alone now</i>

898
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:31,033
<i>There doesn't seem to be anyone around</i>

899
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,536
<i>I think we're alone now</i>

900
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:38,708
<i>The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound</i>

901
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,218
<i>Look at the way</i>

902
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,222
<i>We gotta hide what we're doin'</i>

903
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:57,184
<i>'Cause what would they say</i>

904
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,895
<i>If they ever knew and so we're</i>

905
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:03,899
<i>Running just as fast as we can</i>

906
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:07,402
<i>Holdin' onto one another's hand</i>

907
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,572

<i>And we tumble to the ground
And then you say</i>

910
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,580
<i>- I think we're alone now
- Alone now</i>

911
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:22,584
<i>There doesn't seem to be anyone around</i>

912
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,796

- Alone now</i>

913
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,050
